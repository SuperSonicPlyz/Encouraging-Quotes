# Encouraging Quotes

This is the first ever mod i have made. (Kinda taken from Uproxide's Quotes mod but that wasn't ported to 2.206.)

This mod adds a button to the pause menu and Main menu. The button tells you all sorts of quotes to help cheer up your day and hopefully help you beat a level. There are over 100 different quotes (101 Exactly) which i made by taking inspiration from popular quotes.

there is an extremely rare quote which has a 0.1% chance. if you find it, make sure to ping me in the geode discord. (@mobmastermind)
